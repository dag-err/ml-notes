# Shallow ML Notes

These notes are a dedicated collection of condensed materials relating to "shallow" or classical machine learning (ML). I hope that eventually they will contain a comprehensive, rigorous overview of practical and theoretical concerns of the kind of machine learning that you'd learn in a couple of intro classes.

Prerequisites:

* Probability theory (formal preferred; elementary required)
* Linear algebra

Topics:

* Statistical learning theory
* Computational learning theory
* Bayesian learning
* Optimization for empirical risk minimization
