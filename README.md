# ML Notes

These notes are a dedicated collection of condensed materials relating to machine learning (ML). I hope that eventually they will contain a comprehensive, rigorous overview of practical and theoretical concerns of the kind of machine learning that you'd learn in a couple of intro classes.

Prerequisites:

* Probability theory (formal preferred; elementary required)
* Linear algebra

Topics:

* [Idiosyncrasies](idiosyncrasies.pdf)
* [Statistical learning theory](statistical-learning/README.md)
* [Common models (and their considerations) for ERM-based supervised learning](supervised/README.md)
* [Bayesian-motivated unsupervised learning](unsupervised/README.md)
* Information Theory
* Estimation Theory
* [Deep Learning](deep-learning/README.md)
* Optimization concerns
